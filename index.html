                <span class='stitle'>Keynote: Knowledge Graph Representation Learning and Graph Neural Networks for Language Understanding. <i>Jing Huang (Alexa AI, Conversational Understanding)</i></span>
                <span class='abstract'><b>Abstract:</b> As AI technologies become mature in natural language processing, speech recognition and computer vision, “intelligent” user interfaces emerge to handle complex and diverse tasks that require human-like knowledge and reasoning capability. In Part 1, I will present our recent work on knowledge graph representation learning using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): the first approach is called orthogonal transform embedding (OTE), which integrates graph context into the embedding distance scoring function and improves prediction accuracy on complex relations such as the difficult N-to-1, 1-to-N and N-to-N cases; the second approach is called multi-hop attention GNN (MAGNA), a principled way to incorporate multi-hop context information into every layer of attention computation. MAGNA uses a diffusion prior on attention values, to efficiently account for all paths between the pair of disconnected nodes. Experimental results on knowledge graph completion as well as node classification benchmarks show that MAGNA achieves state-of-the-art results. In Part 2, I will present how we take advantage of GNNs for language understanding and reasoning tasks. We show that combined with large pre-trained language models and knowledge graph embeddings, GNNs are proven effective in multi-hop reading comprehension across documents, improving time sensitivity for question answering over temporal knowledge graphs, and constructing robust syntactic information for aspect-level sentiment analysis.</span>
                <span class='bio'><b>Speaker bio:</b> Dr. Jing Huang currently works at Alexa AI as a senior science manager. Her teams work on advanced conversational AI technology, pushing the boundaries of human-machine interactions with better understanding of context, commonsense reasoning, and personal preferences; and building multi-modal creative AI technology. Prior to Amazon, she had been a senior director of JD Technology, and JD AI Research since 2018. She managed teams working on NLP, speech recognition and computer vision. Her teams had achieved top rankings on the NIST SRE (Speaker Recognition Evaluation) in 2018, WikiHop leaderboard in 2019, and HotpotQA leaderboard in 2021. From 2019 to 2021, Dr. Huang also spent part-time at Stanford AI Lab as a visiting scholar, collaborating research with Stanford SNAP and NLP groups on knowledge graph, NLP and dialog system. Before joining JD, Dr. Huang worked as a principal research scientist at Visa Research, and a senior researcher at Apple Siri team. She joined IBM T. J. Watson Research center after she obtained PhD in computer science at Cornell University. At IBM she had worked on automatic speech recognition, natural language processing and audio-visual integration. Dr. Huang graduated from Tsinghua University, Beijing China with BS degree in applied mathematics.</span>

                <span class='abstract'><b>Abstract:</b> Oh dear, there's that word again - “semantics!”  Isn't that what doomed that Semantic Web thing and led to knowledge graphs instead?  In fact, many of the same problems, and particularly problems with interoperability, arise again for KGs, and thus we must explore the old problem in this new area.  This is even more important when we start to explore the “personal knowledge graph (PKG),” that is, the ability to have private and public information combined in KG technology.  In this talk, I discuss how knowledge graphs, PJGs, linked data and, yes, semantics are all critically linked and why the latter is still relevant to the growth and scaling of knowledge graphs into the future - and specifically to the ability to extract better data from them.</span>
                <span class='bio'><b>Speaker bio:</b> James Hendler is the Director of the Institute for Data Exploration and Applications and the Tetherless World Professor of Computer, Web and Cognitive Sciences at RPI.

            <h2><a id="travel"></a>Student Travel Awards</h2>
            <p>Thanks to the generous support of our Sponsors, we are offering awards for selected students to attend GRADES-NDA and SIGMOD in person. 
		    Each awardee will receive a stipend to partially cover the expense to attend the conference in-person. 
		    Awardees are expected to register to SIGMOD in-person full conference and attend the GRADES-NDA Workshop 
		    and later the SIGMOD conference. Students will have to make their own arrangements for travel and accommodation. 
		    These awards are only for students who can attend in person. 
		    If you cannot attend in person, we advise you to check with SIGMOD travel awards committee (https://2022.sigmod.org/grants.shtml). </p>
            <p><b>Eligibility:</b> Applicants need to be a full-time undergraduate or graduate student. 
		    You  do not need to have an accepted paper to GRADES-NDA (or SIGMOD) to be eligible. 
		    We will primarily prioritize students whose advisors cannot provide financial support. 
		    We will also prioritize students who have a GRADES-NDA accepted paper, who are not from North America and Europe, 
		    as well as female and minority students. </p>
            <p><b>Application Procedure:</b> To apply for a grant, the student must email the necessary materials to GRADES-NDA chairs 
		    (please email both Vasiliki and Semih) by <b>April 22nd</b>. We will notify applicants by <b>April 29th</b>.
		Please submit the following information in a single PDF file with your application:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your full name, school, and email address.</li>
                <li>Your advisor's full name and email address.</li>
                <li>Your CV.</li>
		<li>An at most 1 page (in single column format) abstract, summarizing your thesis research, its connection to graph data management or analytics.</li>
		<li>If you think your presence could help diversity in the GRADES-NDA or SIGMOD community (in terms of the gender, geography/origin, ethnicity or in other ways), please add an additional paragraph with an explanation (does not count towards the 1 page limit for your research).</li>

        <p>GRADES-NDA is in its fourth edition, and had successful joint meetings collocated with SIGMOD/PODS 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 respectively. Specifically, it is the merger of the GRADES and NDA workshops, which were each independently organized and successfully held at previous SIGMOD-PODS meetings, GRADES since 2013 and NDA since 2016. The organizers of GRADES and NDA mutually agreed upon to aim for a joint meeting from 2018 onwards.</p>
