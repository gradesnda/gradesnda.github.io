            <p> The focus of the GRADES-NDA workshop is the application areas, usage scenarios and open challenges in
                managing large-scale graph-shaped data. The workshop is a forum for exchanging ideas and methods for
                mining, querying and learning with real-world network data, developing new common understandings of the
                problems at hand, sharing of data sets and benchmarks where applicable, and leveraging existing
                knowledge from different disciplines. Additionally, considering specific techniques (e.g., algorithms,
                data/index structures) in the context of the systems that implement them, GRADES-NDA aims to present technical 
                contributions inside graph, RDF, and other data management systems on graphs of a large size.

                <span class='abstract'><b>Abstract:</b> Graphs are data model abstractions that are becoming pervasive in several real-life applications and use cases. In these settings, users focus on entities and their relationships, further enhanced with multiple labels and properties to form the so called property graphs. Modern graph processing systems need to keep pace with the increasing fundamental requirements of these applications and to tackle unforeseen challenges. Motivated by a community vision on future graph processing systems, in this talk I will present the system challenges that are lying behind the current research topics on graph processing and graph analytics. Many current graph query engines support subsets of graph queries that they can efficiently evaluate, thus disregarding more expressive query fragments on top of property graphs. It becomes crucial to address efficient query evaluation for complex graph queries, as well the extensibility of the underlying graph query and constraint languages. Moreover, the dynamic aspects of evaluating queries on streaming graphs are equally important and need to be considered in ongoing and future benchmarking efforts. The overarching goal of my talk is to touch upon our past and ongoing work on these topics and to pinpoint the research directions shaping the already bright future of graph processing systems.</span>

                <span class='abstract'><b>Abstract:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic has upended our societies and re-shaped the way we go about our day-to-day lives—from how we work and interact to the way we buy groceries and attend school. Leveraging global data sets that represent billions of people, I will present a series of studies exploring how our behavior, mobility patterns, and social networks have altered and been altered by COVID-19 and the non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented to control its spread. Next, I will examine how we can better incorporate stochasticity and social network heterogeneity and link directionality into forecasting pandemic risk. With these results, I will demonstrate how the complexity of COVID-19 creates epistemological challenges associated with model identifiability. Finally, I will discuss work by Global.health, a new collaborative network of researchers, technologists, and public health experts that has developed and built an open access platform for collecting, storing, securing, and sharing anonymized, individual-level COVID-19 data. Currently, our data includes almost 30M individual-level cases from 160 countries, which are tagged with up to 40 fields of meta-data. Writing for The New York Times Magazine, Steven Johnson said the data captured by Global.health, "may well be the single most accurate portrait of the virus’s spread through the human population in existence."</span>

        <p>GRADES-NDA is in its third edition, and had successful joint meetings collocated with SIGMOD/PODS 2018, 2019, and 2020 respectively. Specifically, it is the merger of the GRADES and NDA workshops, which were each independently organized and successfully held at previous SIGMOD-PODS meetings, GRADES since 2013 and NDA since 2016. The organizers of GRADES and NDA mutually agreed upon to aim for a joint meeting from 2018 onwards.</p>
