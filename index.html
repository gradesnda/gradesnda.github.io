                <span class='stitle'>Keynote by James Cheng (CUHK &amp; Kasma Pte Ltd): <i>Building a Platform for Graph Feature Management</i></span>
                <span style="display: block; margin-top: 0.5em; font-size: smaller; line-height: 1.4em;"><b>Abstract:</b> Graph features are crucial to many applications such as recommender systems and risk management systems. The process to obtain useful graph features involves ingesting data from various upstream data sources, defining the desired graph features for the required applications, constructing a feature engineering workflow to compute the features, and storing and managing the resulting features for downstream tasks (e.g., graph AI and graph BI) and for future reuse. To the majority of users, especially SMEs and non-tech companies, this process poses daunting challenges as it requires users to not only learn various methods (e.g., graph analytical algorithms, non-GNN graph embeddings, GNNs) to define graph features and program their computation, but also learn many infrastructures (e.g., upstream databases, downstream ML systems, graph analytics systems) to compute, manage and use the graph features in production. These challenges have significantly restricted the wider applications of graph technologies such as graph AI and graph BI currently in industry. The current solution provided by major graph database vendors (e.g., Amazon Neptune, Neo4j, TigerGraph) is to connect various upstream and downstream systems to their own graph database, which is used to compute and manage graph features. However, such a solution ties users to a specific graph infrastructure that may not be the preferred infrastructure and may even require them to re-develop their applications on a new infrastructure. In addition, a specific graph database or infrastructure often does not have the best performance for all workloads and certainly does not support the computation of all types of graph features. As a result, the existing solution limits users' flexibility in choosing their own infrastructure and their productivity in developing their applications.
                <br/>
                In Part 1 of this talk, I will introduce various types of graph features and their applications. Then I will present some trends in using graph databases for graph feature computation and management, analyze the limitations of the existing methods, and identify the requirements of a graph feature management solution that is practical and highly usable to average users. In Part 2 of this talk, I will introduce our ongoing project that aims at providing a highly usable graph feature platform. Our solution decouples graph feature logic specification and management (i.e., how features are defined, coded and managed) from the generation and execution of the workflow for feature computation (i.e., execution plan generation and the actual execution), so that users can flexibly select different infrastructures suitable for the computation of specific types of graph features. It also manages the upstream, downstream and feature engineering and serving infrastructures, so as to free users from tedious tasks associated with deploying infrastructures and connecting them in a feature engineering dataflow. Thus, users can focus on creating and delivering innovative feature workflow logic. Finally, I will also highlight some possible future directions about graph feature management.</span>

                <span style="display: block; margin-top: 0.5em; font-size: smaller; line-height: 1.4em;"><b>Abstract:</b> Connectivity is the cornerstone of our contemporary world, permeating various sectors like retail, communications, biology, and finance. Although this inherent interconnectedness holds substantial meaning and predictive power, harnessing it for practical use in the business realm often proves challenging. In this presentation, we will delve into the commercial applications of graph analytics, highlighting both common pitfalls to avoid and promising opportunities to explore.
                <br/>
                To begin, we will explore the prevalent use cases of graph analytics, encompassing areas such as fraud detection, supply chain optimization, data management, and recommendations. We'll also shed light on why many teams tend to deploy only a limited set of graph algorithms. Additionally, we will examine how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the utilization of graphs in business settings.
                <br/>
                Next, we will venture into the major mistakes that businesses often make when implementing graph analytics. These blunders range from technical hurdles like scalability issues and handling tricky data types to human challenges such as fostering a graph-thinking mindset and avoiding excessive perfectionism. Moreover, you will gain quick tips to help teams secure funding for graph projects.
                <br/>
                Lastly, we will delve into some of the most significant prospects within the commercial space. We will address enduring challenges, such as transforming business data into a graph format and ensuring interoperability with production processes. We will also dedicate time to exploring the rising interest in combining graphs with AI systems, particularly the recent buzz surrounding combining graphs with generative AI. While this particular trend garners attention, we will look at other promising opportunities that it may overshadow.
                <br/>
                By the end of this talk, you will have gained a comprehensive understanding of the practical applications of graph analytics in business contexts. Furthermore, you'll gain valuable knowledge about pitfalls to avoid, strategies for securing funding, and a forward-looking perspective on emerging possibilities in this dynamic field.</span>

            <h2><a id="travel"></a>Student Travel Awards</h2>
            <p>Thanks to the generous support of our Sponsors, we are offering awards for selected students to attend GRADES-NDA and SIGMOD in person. 
		    Each awardee will receive a stipend to partially cover the expense to attend the conference in-person. 
		    Awardees are expected to register to SIGMOD in-person full conference and attend the GRADES-NDA Workshop 
		    and later the SIGMOD conference. Students will have to make their own arrangements for travel and accommodation. 
		    These awards are only for students who can attend in person. 
		    If you cannot attend in person, we advise you to check with <a href="https://2023.sigmod.org/grants.shtml">the SIGMOD travel awards committee</a>.</p>
            <p><b>Eligibility:</b> Applicants need to be a full-time undergraduate or graduate student. 
		    You  do not need to have an accepted paper to GRADES-NDA (or SIGMOD) to be eligible. 
		    We will primarily prioritize students whose advisors cannot provide financial support. 
		    We will also prioritize students who have a GRADES-NDA accepted paper, who are not from North America and Europe, 
		    as well as female and minority students. </p>
            <p><b>Application Procedure:</b> To apply for a grant, the student must email the necessary materials to GRADES-NDA chairs 
		    (please email both Olaf and Yuichi) by <b>April 22</b>. We will notify applicants by <b>April 29</b>.
            Please submit the following information in a single PDF file with your application:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your full name, school, and email address.</li>
                <li>Your advisor's full name and email address.</li>
                <li>Your CV.</li>
                <li>An abstract, summarizing your thesis research and its connection to graph data management or graph analytics (at most one page in single column format).</li>
                <li>If you think your presence could help diversity in the GRADES-NDA or SIGMOD community (in terms of the gender, geography/origin, ethnicity or in other ways), please add an additional paragraph with an explanation (does not count towards the one-page limit for your research).</li>

        <p>GRADES-NDA is in its sixth edition, and had successful joint meetings collocated with SIGMOD/PODS 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively. Specifically, it is the merger of the GRADES and NDA workshops, which were each independently organized and successfully held at previous SIGMOD-PODS meetings, GRADES since 2013 and NDA since 2016. The organizers of GRADES and NDA mutually agreed upon to aim for a joint meeting from 2018 onwards.</p>
