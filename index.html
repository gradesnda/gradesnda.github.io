            <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
            <p> The goal of GRADES-NDA is to bring together researchers from academia, industry, and government (1) to
                create a forum for discussing recent advances in (large-scale) graph data management and graph analytics
                systems, as well as propose and discuss novel methods and techniques towards (2) addressing domain-specific challenges or (3) handling noise in real-world graphs.</p>
            <p>The workshop will be of interest to researchers in the development of novel data-management applications
                and systems for large-scale graph analytics. More specifically, the intended audience are, but not
                limited to, academic and industrial computer scientists interested in databases and data mining, machine

            <h2><a id="travel"></a>Student Travel Awards</h2>
            <p>Thanks to the generous support of our Sponsors, we are offering awards for selected students to attend GRADES-NDA and SIGMOD in person. 
		    Each awardee will receive a stipend to partially cover the expense to attend the conference in-person. 
		    Awardees are expected to register to SIGMOD in-person full conference and attend the GRADES-NDA Workshop 
		    and later the SIGMOD conference. Students will have to make their own arrangements for travel and accommodation. 
		    These awards are only for students who can attend in person. 
		    If you cannot attend in person, we advise you to check with <a href="https://2023.sigmod.org/grants.shtml">the SIGMOD travel awards committee</a>.</p>
            <p><b>Eligibility:</b> Applicants need to be a full-time undergraduate or graduate student. 
		    You  do not need to have an accepted paper to GRADES-NDA (or SIGMOD) to be eligible. 
		    We will primarily prioritize students whose advisors cannot provide financial support. 
		    We will also prioritize students who have a GRADES-NDA accepted paper, who are not from North America and Europe, 
		    as well as female and minority students. </p>
            <p><b>Application Procedure:</b> To apply for a grant, the student must email the necessary materials to GRADES-NDA chairs 
		    (please email both Olaf and Yuichi) by <b>April 22</b>. We will notify applicants by <b>April 29</b>.
            Please submit the following information in a single PDF file with your application:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your full name, school, and email address.</li>
                <li>Your advisor's full name and email address.</li>
                <li>Your CV.</li>
                <li>An abstract, summarizing your thesis research and its connection to graph data management or graph analytics (at most one page in single column format).</li>
                <li>If you think your presence could help diversity in the GRADES-NDA or SIGMOD community (in terms of the gender, geography/origin, ethnicity or in other ways), please add an additional paragraph with an explanation (does not count towards the one-page limit for your research).</li>

        <p>GRADES-NDA is in its eigth edition, and had successful joint meetings co-located with ACM SIGMOD/PODS from 2018 to 2024. Specifically, it is the merger of the GRADES and NDA workshops, which were each independently organized and successfully held at previous ACM SIGMOD/PODS conferences, GRADES since 2013 and NDA since 2017. The organizers of GRADES and NDA mutually agreed upon to aim for a joint meeting from 2018 onwards.</p>
