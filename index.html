            <span class="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b> 
                Digital technologies allow us to quantify many important human behaviors and have revolutionized how we think about human mobility, opening new avenues for research in computational social science, urban mobility, epidemiology, and more. This talk will focus on human proximity networks measured using wearable proximity sensors, reviewing the decade-long experience of the SocioPatterns collaboration. We will discuss the evolution and state of the art of measurement technology and the lessons learned from more than a decade of data collection experiences in various real-world environments, including schools, hospitals, households, low-resource rural settings, and more. We will illustrate the complex features and emergent patterns of time-resolved proximity networks and discuss how ideas and methods from network science and machine learning can support their modeling in important application scenarios. We will highlight open challenges in the low-dimensional representation of time-resolved interaction networks and in the development of generative models of realistic interaction data.

            <span class="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b> 
                Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a cornerstone of graph-based machine learning, demonstrating strong performance across a variety of applications spanning recommendation systems, molecular analysis, and social networks. While a wide variety of GNN models have been proposed, most of them perform best in graphs that exhibit the property of homophily, in which linked nodes often belong to the same class or have similar features, echoing the adage “birds of a feather flock together”. 
                In this talk, I will present our recent advances in understanding and improving GNNs in the presence of heterophily. I will introduce effective GNN designs for node classification and link prediction, and present a learnable variant of Laplacian positional encodings that generalizes to heterophilic graphs and improves performance across a range of architectures, including graph transformers. Beyond static node classification, I will introduce a dynamic homophily metric that more accurately correlates with GNN performance on dynamic graphs. I will then discuss how heterophily relates to core challenges such as oversmoothing and robustness. Moving beyond global homophily, I will demonstrate how local homophily variations can lead to performance disparities across node groups, ultimately resulting in unfair predictions. I will conclude with a retrospective on the field’s progress over the past five years and outline directions for future research.

            <span class="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b> 
                The GQL standard was introduced just over a year ago, following the earlier release of SQL/PGQ — both based on a shared graph pattern-matching. Their design was primarily driven by industry, with academia largely responding in its wake. In the short time that was available, we have created formal models of GQL and PGQ, differing in how closely they adhere to the standards, and used them to analyze both languages. This talk will provide an overview of these models and recent insights into the expressive power of GQL queries, pointing out current limitations and suggesting research directions for future improvements of graph query standards.

            <h2><a id="travel"></a>Student Travel Awards</h2>
            <p>Thanks to the generous support of our Sponsors, we are offering awards for selected students to attend GRADES-NDA@SIGMOD in person. 
		    Each awardee will receive a stipend to <b>partially cover</b> the expense to attend the conference in-person. 
		    Awardees are expected to register and attend the GRADES-NDA Workshop 
		    and encouraged to attend the SIGMOD conference. Students will have to make their own arrangements for travel and accommodation. 
		    These awards are only for students who can attend in person. 
		    If you cannot attend in person, we advise you to check with <a href="https://2025.sigmod.org/travel_awards.shtml">the SIGMOD travel awards committee</a>.</p>
            <p><b>Eligibility:</b> Applicants need to be full-time undergraduate or graduate students. 
		    You do not need to have an accepted paper to GRADES-NDA (or SIGMOD) to be eligible. 
		    We will primarily prioritize students whose advisors cannot provide financial support. 
		    We will also prioritize students who have a GRADES-NDA accepted paper, who are not from North America or Europe, 
		    as well as female and minority students. </p>
            <p><b>Application Procedure:</b> To apply for a grant, the student must email the necessary materials to GRADES-NDA chairs (at our email address: gradesnda2025@easychair.org) by <b>May 23</b>. 
		    We will notify applicants by <b>May 30</b>.
                    Please submit the following information in a single PDF file with your application:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your full name, school, and email address.</li>
                <li>Your advisor's full name and email address.</li>
                <li>Your CV.</li>
                <li>An abstract, summarizing your thesis research and its connection to graph data management or graph analytics (at most one page in single column format).</li>
                <li>If you think your presence could help diversity in the GRADES-NDA or SIGMOD community (in terms of the gender, geography/origin, ethnicity or in other ways), please add an additional paragraph with an explanation (does not count towards the one-page limit for your research).</li>

        <p>GRADES-NDA is in its eigth edition, and had successful joint meetings co-located with ACM SIGMOD/PODS from 2018 to 2024. Specifically, it is the merger of the GRADES and NDA workshops, which were each independently organized and successfully held at previous ACM SIGMOD/PODS conferences: GRADES (since 2013) and NDA (since 2017). The organizers of GRADES and NDA mutually agreed upon a joint meeting from 2018 onwards.</p><br>
