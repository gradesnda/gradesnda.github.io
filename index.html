            <p> The focus of the GRADES-NDA workshop is the application areas, usage scenarios and open challenges in
                managing large-scale graph-shaped data. The workshop is a forum for exchanging ideas and methods for
                mining, querying and learning with real-world network data, developing new common understandings of the
                problems at hand, sharing of data sets and benchmarks where applicable, and leveraging existing
                knowledge from different disciplines. Additionally, considering specific techniques (e.g., algorithms,
                data/index structures) in the context of the systems that implement them, GRADES-NDA aims to present technical 
                contributions inside graph, RDF, and other data management systems on graphs of a large size.

                <span class='abstract'><b>Abstract:</b> More and more knowledge graphs are becoming available on the
Web, many of them accessible via queryable interfaces, such as
SPARQL endpoints. These knowledge graphs are often linked to
each other and in doing so form the so-called Web of Data. The
great strength and potential of exploiting these links is that we can
obtain answers for queries that would not yield any results over the
knowledge graphs if considered individually. However, one of the
fundamental problems is that Web-accessible knowledge graphs
are not always available when we would like to access them. This
means that the exact same query issued at different points in time
might have different results or, in the worst case, no results if one
of the knowledge graphs that are essential to answer the query
is (temporarily) not available. Often this is caused by crashes of
the server hosting the knowledge graph – a problem that is deeply
rooted within the architecture of the current Web of Data, i.e.,
relying on data providers to keep interfaces and knowledge graphs
available and accessible. Building upon the basics of federated query
processing over knowledge graphs, this talk will discuss challenges
as well as strategies on how to overcome the unavailability problem
and keep the data available and queryable.</span>

                <span class='abstract'><b>Abstract:</b> Graph neural networks (GNNs) have received more and more attention in past several years, due to the wide applications of graphs
and networks, and the superiority of their performance compared
to traditional heuristics-driven approaches. However, most existing
GNNs still focus on node-level applications, such as node classification and link prediction, and many challenging graph tasks are
graph-level, such as graph search. In this talk, I will introduce our
recent progress on graph-level neural operator development. In
particular, we will examine three challenging tasks that are key
to the success of graph search: (1) How can we conduct efficient
graph similarity search by turning the NP-Complete problems, such
as the Graph Edit Distance (GED) and Maximum Common Sub-graph (MCS) computation, into a learning problem? We will present
SimGNN and GraphSim that are able to provide more efficient and effective results compared to state-of-the-art approximate
algorithms. (2) How can we provide a neural operator that can turn
any graph into a low dimensional representation vector, which is
learnable, inductive, and unsupervised? In this line, we propose
UGraphEmd that is able to leverage graph-graph interaction
to produce manifold-preserving graph-level embedding. Moreover,
GHashing is designed to map each graph to a discrete hash code,
which enables a much more efficient search (20 times speed up) to
handle large graph database with millions of graphs. And (3) how
can we design GNNs that can directly detect the best matched sub-
graphs of two graphs? A deep reinforcement learning framework
RLMCS is then proposed to address this issue, with the goal
to learn the best strategy to pick the next matching pair for two
graphs. In the end, we will provide some discussions to the open
questions in the field.</span>

            <p>The workshop will be of interest to researchers in the development of novel data-management applications
                and systems for large-scale graph analytics. More specifically, the intended audience are, but not
                limited to, academic and industrial computer scientists interested in databases and data mining, machine
                learning, data streaming, graph theory and algorithms. Along with novel research work, we encourage
                submissions with demonstrations and case studies from real-life experiences in various domains such as
                Social Networks, Biological Network Data, Marketing and Media, Business Data Analysis, Healthcare Data,
                Cybersecurity etc.
            </p>
            <p>Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Graph query languages, visualization techniques and querying interfaces, and their effective realization</li>
                <li>Graph platform and parallel platforms,  e.g., Flink/Gelly, Titan, SPARK/GraphX, GraphLab/PowerGraph, Giraph, GraphChi etc.</li>
                <li>Network data representation, storage, indexing and querying methods.</li>
                <li>Experiences or techniques for graph specific operations such as traversals or inference/reasoning in the context of large data sets and on the systems that implement those operations.</li>
                <li>RDF data management and analytics</li>
                <li>Dynamic Graphs: managing graph updates; graph stream analytics; analyzing evolution and detection of community structures in real-world evolving graphs</li>
                <li>Mining and machine learning on heterogeneous networks -- knowledge graphs etc.</li>
                <li>Graph summarization and sampling</li>
                <li>Game Theory, Social contagion and Information propagation on networks</li>
                <li>Analytics on dirty, noisy, or uncertain graphs</li>
                <li>Spatial and temporal graph analytics</li>
                <li>Analytics on social, biological, retail, marketing, customer care, financial, healthcare, transportation network data sets</li>
                <li> Descriptions of graph data management use cases and query workloads, and experiences with applying data management technologies in such situations</li>
                <li>Vision and systems papers describing potential or real applications and benefits of graph management</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p> Accepted papers will be published by ACM, indexed by DBLP, and would be available in the ACM DL.</p>

        <p>GRADES-NDA is in its third edition, and had successful joint meetings collocated with SIGMOD/PODS 2018 and 2019 respectively. Specifically, it is the merger of the GRADES and NDA workshops, which were each independently organized and successfully held at previous SIGMOD-PODS meetings, GRADES since 2013 and NDA since 2016. The organizers of GRADES and NDA mutually agreed upon to aim for a joint meeting from 2018 onwards.</p>
